FinTech Case Study

# Capital Investment – Algorithmic Trading Firm

## Overview and Origin

Algorithmic trading is a method of executing orders using automated pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for variables such as time, price, and volume. This type of trading attempts to leverage the speed and computational resources of computers relative to human traders. In the twenty-first century, algorithmic trading has been gaining traction with both retail and institutional traders. Investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds use algorithmic trading to spread out the execution of a larger order or perform trades too fast for human traders to execute. A study in 2019 showed that trading algorithms rather than humans performed around 92% of trading in the Forex market.

The term algorithmic trading is often used synonymously with an automated trading system. These encompass various trading strategies, some of which employ formulas and results from mathematical finance and often rely on specialized software. Examples of strategies used in algorithmic trading include market making, inter-market spreading, arbitrage, or pure speculation such as trend following. Many fall into the category of high-frequency trading (HFT), in which high turnover and high order-to-trade ratios are paramount. HFT strategies utilize computers that make elaborate decisions to initiate orders based on information received electronically before human traders observe and process information. Algorithmic trading and HFT have resulted in a dramatic change of the market microstructure and the complexity, which defines uncertainty. As a result, in February 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formed a particular working group that included academics and industry experts to advise the CFTC on how best to define HFT.

Financial markets with fully electronic execution and similar electronic communication networks developed in the late 1980s and 1990s. In the U.S.A., decimalization, which changed the minimum tick size from 1/16 of a dollar (US$0.0625) to US$0.01 per share, may have encouraged algorithmic trading. The market microstructure changed and permitted more minor differences between the bid and offer prices, decreasing the market-maker's trading advantage, thus increasing market liquidity. Till 1998 U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized electronic exchanges paving the way for computerized High-Frequency Trading. HFT was able to execute trades 1000 times faster than a human.

Moreover, since that time, high-frequency trading (HFT) has become widespread. By the year 2001, HFT trades had an execution time of several seconds. By 2010 this had shrunk to milliseconds, even microseconds, and subsequently nanoseconds in 2012. In the early 2000s, high-frequency trading accounted for less than 10% of equity orders, but this has proliferated. Between 2005 and 2009, according to NYSE, high-frequency trading volume grew by 164%.

The whole idea is to gain access to federal data milliseconds faster than other traders. It can travel at the speed of light via fiber-optic lines to markets in New York, New Jersey, and Chicago. All of it—the information's transmission, translation, and trading in a journey from Washington to market servers in New Jersey, New York, and Chicago—happens faster than the speed of human thought. It takes a person 300 milliseconds to blink an eye. However, these algorithmic trading firms compete in a global telecommunications arms race, where a single millisecond determines victory or defeat.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Boosted.ai is a technology and data collection company, which utilizes machine learning and natural language processing in the fintech arena. an artificial intelligence company that enhances portfolio management outcomes for the global financial industry through distributed machine learning. Their platform, Boosted Insights®, brings advanced quantitative investing techniques to portfolio managers, without requiring any coding or data science background.
 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Today, the demand for digitized, convenient financial services has soared, and, as such, the opportunities to participate in exciting investment opportunities can be achieved with just a few taps of a smartphone. But of all these game-changing technologies, it is perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) that has the capacity to most transform—and most improve—the investing process. AI typically refers to using computers to simulate intelligent behavior that’s comparable,  or even superior, to that of human beings. And when one looks around, it’s clear that those computers have not only arrived but are now changing the world in dramatic ways.

The same goes for investing, too. Already, automated systems are providing a more significant contribution within the investment process, particularly as their abilities to outperform humans in the markets keep growing. And now, investment firms are employing AI to make faster, smarter, and more profitable investing decisions. Investing is the ultimate numbers game, and smart number crunchers tend to be good at it. Moreover, artificial intelligence as a high-capacity data processor stands a good chance at revolutionizing the investment industry. Finally, Machine learning (ML) is arguably the most exciting aspect of this revolution. An application of AI, ML involves utilizing data to learn, adapt and improve investment decisions without needing to be explicitly programmed to do so. By formulating various algorithms and then exposing them to substantial volumes of relevant data—such as historic market prices and transactional data—ML systems can be trained to quickly identify security mispricing and market inefficiencies. And as a result, they can detect more potential opportunities to generate alpha, which ultimately translates into a higher chance of investors and fund managers making money.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

There are four major companies in this domain. They are Decentriq, UlakFin, Vidrona and ConfirmU respectively. All four companies are private, reside outside of the continental United States of America and were founded within the past five years. Each of the four companies are within the technology domain, albeit Decentriq is a company providing a cloud-based platform that enables enterprises top access their information. Moreover, both Vidrona and ConfirmU identify as a predictive and/or data analytics company. Finally, Boosted.ai employs the largest STEM workforce and their twitter followers dwarf their competitors by 50%.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Boosted.ai’s proprietary investment management platform brings Boosted Insights®, advanced quantitative investing techniques to portfolio managers, without requiring any coding or data science background.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Companies in the FinTech, Data Collection and Portfolio Management space must provide explainable AI to their customer-base. This is not a nice-to-have, it’s a must. In order to pass muster for asset managers, any reason our machine learning algorithms make decisions must be transparent to their stakeholders. Boosted.ai aims to build the best and most predictive models. To do this, we use Information Coefficient. Information Coefficient shows the highest possible correlation to the raw return of the stocks in any given universe. Finally, Within any specified universe, input space and investment horizon, Boosted.ai creates models with a high Information Coefficient, meaning the model is successful in predicting stocks that will beat or lose the benchmark.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Currently, Boosted.ai’s portfolio with factor constraints has outperformed competitors by 29.33% since September 2020. Also, their AI portfolio without factor constraints has still beaten its benchmark, but only by 2.23 percentage points. Finally, Last August, Boosted.ai shared how their machine learning models performed using factor constraints. They highlighted how using portfolio optimizations and factor constraints within their machine learning platform – Boosted Insights® – were able to improve portfolio returns by over 10% during the March 2020 market crash. Though August 2020 feels like a lifetime (or two) ago, it was only 10 months, so Boosted.ai thought it would be a good time to share how those models have performed in the time since. 
 
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
In addition to their proprietary, finance-specific machine learning models that augments idea generation and portfolio construction without requiring any coding or data science background, I would recommend they expand their operation into data/predictive analytics. Their experience in machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence could be applied to language translation, satellite reconnaissance and/or geospatial intelligence.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Many factors could cause investors to flee from the financial markets e.g., war, political upheaval, massive inflation, or natural disasters. Hence, positioning the Boosted.ai to quickly move into the defense/intelligence domain would insure their survivability and profitability.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

As new geospatial data sources come online the variety and velocity of this data makes it increasingly difficult to find the answers to intelligence problems manually. Defense Contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton provides insights into how they use the Databricks ML Runtime coupled with geospatial libraries like GeoMesa to accelerate GEOINT workflows. By combining these powerful tools, they team uses computer vision algorithms to extract data from imagery, build patterns of life with time series analysis and co-traveler analytics, and answer key intelligence questions in a digestible way using Databricks built in notebook and dashboard visualizations.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The recent global working climate, altered by COVID-19, has driven considerable change in how the geospatial community delivers support and new capabilities for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). The pandemic forced analysts to work from home without the advanced infrastructure required for ML, but the high demands of mission requirements remained. Therefore, the geospatial community had to adapt. New technologies are accommodating workflow gaps, existing technologies are being leveraged in new and innovative ways, and from an operational and cultural perspective, teams are embracing new approaches to their work. Finally, While COVID-19 caused many initial concerns, the geospatial community adapted and continues to progress with AI/ML initiatives and efforts. Adapting to the workforce impacts of COVID-19 has had some benefits to AI/ML delivery.
